This is a simple low-interaction port monitoring honeypot, designed
primarily for research and detection purposes. It uses netcat as a
port listener, tshark to attempt to capture attack traffic, and (by
default) notify-send to alert the user when a possible attack is
detected. The honeypot itself is written in bash, and allows for easy
extension of emulated services with additional bash scripts. In order
to increase security, the script should NOT be run as root, or with
any elevated privelages. All it needs is the ability to run the
required programs, read permissions on its plugins and configuration,
and write permissions in whatever directory you choose to save the
logs.
